# H4X-News
 A Hot Topic News app made with swfitUI

## Features

- **SwiftUI views and layout:**
  - `List` for dynamic, scrollable content presentation
  - `NavigationView` for hierarchical navigation between views

- **Observer design pattern:**
  - Used `ObservableObject` and `@Published` to manage and observe state updates across views

- **Networking:**
  - Fetched real-time data from the [Hacker News public API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)
  - Performed asynchronous API calls using `URLSession`
  - Managed loading state and error handling for network responses

- **JSON decoding:**
  - Parsed API responses using Swiftâ€™s `Decodable` protocol
  - Structured data into models for clean and type-safe usage in UI

- **MVVM Architecture:**
  - Separated view logic (ViewModel) from UI (View) for better code organization and testing
